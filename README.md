# Brain CT Image Classification and Segmentation ðŸ§ 

This repository contains my machine learning experiments with classifying brain CT images into different categories and exploring segmentation techniques. The project includes:

- Classification models for **3-class** (meningioma, glioma, pituitary) and **4-class** (+healthy) setups.
- A probe implementation of **U-Net segmentation** to demonstrate the potential for region-based learning.

## Project Focus
The main focus of this project is on:
1. **Data preprocessing** to prepare images and masks for training.
2. Experimenting with **classification models** to distinguish between different brain tumor types.
3. **Segmentation** using U-Net as a proof-of-concept for highlighting regions of interest.
